# Counter App
This project is built on the side of my Codecademy full-stack career path as a compliment to the course about DOM that I recently completed in addition to event handling.

## How to use
Just open up the index.html file in your browser and make sure to have JavaScript enabled.
To interact with the app either use your keyboard ("+", "0", "r" and "-", have some kind of functionality implemented) or press the buttons on the screen.
